Real-Time Vehicle Telemetry Dashboard with AI Capabilities

This project provides a complete solution for reading live data from a vehicle's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port and displaying it on a modern, web-based dashboard. Powered by an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, this platform not only visualizes data but also serves as a foundation for in-car AI, computer vision, and sensor fusion applications.

The server is designed to be resilient, featuring an automatic "Demo Mode" that generates simulated data if no OBD-II adapter is connected, making it perfect for development and showcasing without a physical vehicle connection.
Key Features ‚ú®

  * AI-Ready Platform: Hosted on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, enabling future expansion into real-time AI tasks like object detection from the camera feed or sensor fusion with LIDAR data.
  * Real-Time Data Streaming: Connects to any standard ELM327-based OBD-II adapter and streams key vehicle metrics over WebSockets.
  * Comprehensive Metrics: Gathers and displays a wide range of data, including:
      * Primary Metrics: RPM, Vehicle Speed, Engine Load, Coolant Temperature, Fuel Level, and more.
      * Calculated Metrics: Real-time MPG, Acceleration (m/s2), Trip Distance, and Total Idling Time.
      * Vehicle Status: Ignition State and Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs).
  * Advanced Visualization: The dashboard features side-by-side windows for:
      * Live Camera Feed: A real-time video stream from a connected webcam.
      * LIDAR Visualization: A top-down, 2D representation of LIDAR point-cloud data (currently simulated).
  * Remote Accessibility: Includes instructions for using localtunnel to easily and securely expose the dashboard to the internet, allowing you to monitor your vehicle from anywhere.
Hardware & Software Requirements
Hardware üõ†Ô∏è

1.  NVIDIA Jetson Nano: This powerful, compact AI computer serves as the brain of the project, running the backend server.
2.  USB OBD-II Adapter: A standard ELM327-based adapter with a USB connection.
3.  Webcam: A standard USB webcam compatible with the Jetson Nano.
4.  LIDAR Sensor: A 2D or 3D LIDAR sensor compatible with the Jetson Nano for future expansion.
Software üíª

  * Jetson Nano OS: Flashed with the official NVIDIA JetPack SDK.
  * Python 3.7+
  * Required Python Libraries:
      * pyserial: For communicating with the USB adapter.
      * websockets: For real-time data streaming to the dashboard.
  * localtunnel (Optional): A command-line tool for exposing the server to the internet. Requires npm/nodejs.
Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your telemetry dashboard up and running on the Jetson Nano.
1. Install Python Dependencies

Open a terminal on your Jetson Nano and install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

pip install pyserial websockets


2. Install localtunnel (Optional)

If you want to access your dashboard from outside your local network, you'll need to install localtunnel.

# Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install npm nodejs -y

# Install localtunnel globally
sudo npm install -g localtunnel


3. Connect the Hardware

1.  Plug the OBD-II adapter into your vehicle's OBD-II port.
2.  Turn the vehicle's ignition to the "On" position.
3.  Connect the USB end of the adapter to one of the Jetson Nano's USB ports.
4.  Connect your webcam to another USB port on the Jetson Nano.
How to Use
1. Start the Server

Open a terminal on your Jetson Nano, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

python3 server.py


  * The server will automatically try to connect to the OBD-II adapter at /dev/ttyUSB0.
  * If it succeeds, it will initialize the adapter and start broadcasting live vehicle data on port 8080.
  * If it fails, it will notify you and start broadcasting simulated data in Demo Mode.
2. Accessing the Dashboard
Method A: Local Network Access

While the server is running, you can access the dashboard from any device on the same Wi-Fi network.

1.  Find the local IP address of your Jetson Nano (e.g., 192.168.1.15).
2.  On another device (phone, tablet, laptop), open a web browser and navigate to:
    http://<JETSON_NANO_IP>:8000/index.html
Method B: Internet Access with localtunnel

To access your dashboard from anywhere in the world, you must set up separate secure tunnels for the main data and the camera feed.

    Start OBD-II Data Tunnel (Port 8080)
        Open a new terminal window on the Jetson Nano and run:
        bash     lt --port 8080     
        Note: Save the public wss:// URL provided (e.g., wss://obd-tunnel.loca.lt).

    Start Camera Feed Tunnel (Port 8081)
    Open a second new terminal window and run:
        bash     lt --port 8081     
    Note: Save the public wss:// URL provided (e.g., wss://camera-tunnel.loca.lt).

    Update Dashboard JavaScript
        Open your dashboard.js file and update the two WebSocket connection URLs to use the secure public addresses (wss://) you just generated:
        ```javascript
        // Update the URL for the OBD-II Data connection
        const OBD_WEBSOCKET_URL = 'wss://obd-tunnel.loca.lt';

    // Update the URL for the Camera Feed connection
    const CAMERA_WEBSOCKET_URL = 'wss://camera-tunnel.loca.lt';
    ```
4.  Access Dashboard
    Now you can access your hosted index.html from any device with an internet connection.
